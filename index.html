<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="heading-element" dir="auto" tabindex="-1">Abstract:</h3>
<p>Conversational AI is revolutionizing human-computer interactions, enabling more natural and intuitive engagements across industries such as customer service, healthcare, and education. However, ensuring that these AI-driven conversations align with human needs, ethical considerations, and usability principles is a growing challenge. This tutorial introduces participants to key concepts in Conversational AI and Human-Centered AI, focusing on designing intelligent systems that prioritize user experience, inclusivity, and fairness.</p>
<p>Participants will explore key methodologies in conversational AI, such as dialogue management, intent recognition, and natural language understanding. The tutorial will also address Human-Centered AI principles, emphasizing transparency, accountability, and ethical decision-making in AI interactions. Discussions will include best practices, real-world case studies, and challenges in deploying AI-driven communication systems.</p>
<p>Participants will engage in hands-on exercises using industry-standard tools to prototype and evaluate conversational AI systems. The session will also address ethical concerns, bias mitigation, and responsible AI practices. By the end of the tutorial, attendees will acquire practical skills to develop user-friendly, ethical, and effective conversational AI solutions.</p>
